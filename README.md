# Face Detection with Mask Detection - Computer Vision Project

## Overview

This project focuses on real-time face detection with the added capability of determining whether a detected face is wearing a mask or not. The application utilizes computer vision techniques to analyze video streams or images, identifying faces and classifying them based on the presence of masks.

## Features

- **Real-time Face Detection:** The system can detect faces in real-time through a camera feed or static images.

- **Mask Detection:** The application goes a step further by classifying each detected face as either wearing a mask or not.
